# unruh_deWitt_on_RindlerAdS_and_static_BTZ
Numerical analyses of ["Comments on the anti-Hawking effect on a BTZ black hole spacetime"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07201) regarding an Unruh-deWitt detector on Rindler-AdS spacetime and on a static BTZ black hole. There are two notebooks, a Mathematica one written in Wolfram Language and a Jupyter one, written in Python. Both have basically the same content. 

The Mathematica notebook uses two packages. One is for transforming ordinary differential equations [ODEsTransformations](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/ODEsTransformations) and the other is for generating plots with Latex style [LatexPlot](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/latex_style). The latter has its own dependencies as well ([MaTeX](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/9355/) and [CustomTicks](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/5599/)). 

The Jupyter notebook uses the libraries: numpy, mpmath and plotly.graph_objects.
