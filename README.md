# unruh_deWitt_on_RindlerAdS_and_static_BTZ
Numerical analyses of "Comments on the anti-Hawking effect on a BTZ black hole spacetime" regarding an Unruh-deWitt detector on Rindler-AdS spacetime and on a static BTZ black hole. There are two notebooks, a Mathematica one written in Wolfram Language and a Jupyter one, written in Python. Both have basically the same content.
